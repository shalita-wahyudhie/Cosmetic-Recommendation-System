# Cosmetic Recommendation System

### Libraries used
* pandas
* Numpy
* scikit learn
* Bokeh

<p>When it comes to new cosmetics products, especially skincare, it's so difficult to choose. Sometimes it is even scary because new items could end up giving us skin trouble. We know the information we need is on the back of each product, but it's really hard to interpret those ingredient lists unless we're a cosmetic chemist. You may be able to relate to this situation.</p>
<p>In this project, I build a  simple cosmetic recommendation system with t-SNE for dimension reduction, cosine similarity (dot product for normalized vectors). The dataset used in this project contained information about large number of cosmetics products from sephora and is provided by [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/) and includes the brand, product name, list of the ingredients, and the compatibility with different skin types. For this project, I focused specifically on moisturizer products for combination skin type.</p>
<p> The bokeh plot for t-SNE features generated in this course can be seen in the repo file. The plot doesn't exhibit clearly divided groups or clusters since the data has more than 2000 features.</p>
